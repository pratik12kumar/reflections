When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote reository can be used to collaborate with others by sharing your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We want to be in control as to when we want to pull changes in  the local repository. only when a logical change has been acheived on github , would we want to pull that  change in our local.
